TODO: Need to include link to the protocol once everything is posted online. 

In this notebook, I will provide final analyses for experiment 1 in the paper "Of Primary Importance? Motivation Drives Resource Allocation Across Concurrent Tasks During Multimedia Processing." 

In this experiment, participants played three ten-minute rounds of *Asteroid Impact*. One of these rounds contained a cognitive load manipulation (a 1-back memory maintenance task) and one of these rounds contained a perceptual load manipulation (a haze overlay). Perceptual load findings are reported elsewhere, and as such will not be analyzed here (Fisher, Hopp, Lonergan, & Weber, 2018). The third round contained neither the perceptual load nor the cognitive load manipulation, but was otherwise equivalent in gameplay mechanics. All rounds were presented in randomized order.

During the course of gameplay, participants also responded to a secondary task. In this task, participants pressed "x" upon seeing a purple square appear on screen and pressed "z" upon seeing a blue triangle appear on screen. The square was associated with a much higher point reward than was the triangle, although both appeared with equal frequency. 

More information regarding the protocol for this experiment can be found [here]


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
